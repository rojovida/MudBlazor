### Description

<!--
* Please share a clear and concise description of the performance issue with MudBlazor components.
* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible Blazor component code snippet; or a small repo to clone, with steps to run it.
* Specify which MudBlazor components are involved (e.g., MudDataGrid, MudTable, MudSelect, etc.)
  -->

### Configuration

<!--
* Which version of MudBlazor are you using?
* Which version of .NET is your Blazor app running on?
* Are you using Blazor Server or Blazor WebAssembly?
* What OS version, and what distro if applicable?
* What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?
* If relevant, what are the specs of the machine and browser?
  -->

### Regression?

<!--
* Is this a regression from a previous version of MudBlazor? If you can try a previous version to find out, that can help us narrow down the problem. If you don't know, that's OK.
* Please specify the last known good version if this is a regression.
  -->

### Data

<!--
* Please include any benchmark results, browser dev tools performance measurements, or timing data that are relevant.
* Include details about the dataset size (e.g., number of rows in MudDataGrid, items in MudSelect, etc.)
* If possible please include text as text rather than images (so it shows up in searches).
* If applicable please include before and after measurements.
* Browser network tab screenshots can be helpful for identifying excessive network requests.
  -->

### Analysis

<!--
* If you have an idea where the problem might lie (e.g., excessive re-renders, large DOM updates, inefficient data binding), let us know that here.
* Please include any pointers to specific MudBlazor components, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.
* If you suspect it's related to a specific component feature or parameter, mention that here.
* If you don't know, you can delete this section.
